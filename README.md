# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this repository was to create a function that would 
take movie data from Wikipedia and Kaggle as inputs. Then clean the 
data so that columns and units of measurement (runtime, dates, etc.) were 
standardized and coming from the best source. And finally create a SQL
database out of the information.
